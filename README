This is a machine learning project I decided to make in order to learn about the software and algorithms I could use in more a more complex project. The book I'm reading to learn the topic is Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques (2011) by Ian H. Witten, Eibe Frank, and Mark A. Hall. After skimming the book, the tools I expect to use for data analysis are Java and the Weka Java packages.

My idea for this practice project is to made a program that solves a common machine learning problem. I want to try using the Naive Bayes algorithm for text classification on some data that interests me. If I can find data to support this idea, I'd like to comb through social media posts about climate change and categorize them based on whether the posts express belief, nonbelief, or neither about the topic. Climate change is a topic I'm interested in, so I could also look for climate data from climate.nasa.gov.
