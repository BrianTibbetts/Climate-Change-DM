Climate-Change-DM is a data mining project I'm planning for data related to climate change. I want to start by making a text classification program. If I can find data to support this idea, I'd like to comb through social media posts about climate change and categorize them based on whether the posts express positive, negative, or neutral opinions about the topic.

Right now, I'm still learning about data mining, machine learning, and the algorithms and software I could use to start the project. The book I'm reading is Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques (2011) by Ian H. Witten, Eibe Frank, and Mark A. Hall.
