Climate-Change-DM is a data mining project I'm planning for data related to climate change. Using data from the [NOAA](https://www.climate.gov/maps-data/datasets/formats/csv), I want to try finding associations between indicators of climate change. Climate scientists have struggled to understand how each component of climate indirectly affects the other components. I think using machine learning algorithms to mine climate data could help show how different pieces of the climate system are related.

Right now, I'm still learning about data mining, machine learning, and the algorithms and software I could use to start the project. The book I'm reading is Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques (2011) by Ian H. Witten, Eibe Frank, and Mark A. Hall.
