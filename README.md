Climate-Change-DM is a data mining project I'm planning for data related to climate change. Using data from the [NOAA](https://www.climate.gov/maps-data/datasets/formats/csv), I want to try finding associations between indicators of climate change. Climate scientists have struggled to understand how each component of climate indirectly affects the other components. I think using machine learning algorithms to mine climate data could help show how different pieces of the climate system are related.

I learned about data mining, machine learning, and the algorithms and software I could use to start the project by reading Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques (2011) by Ian H. Witten, Eibe Frank, and Mark A. Hall.

The data set I analyzed came from here:
